This is a Loan Approval Prediction System built using Machine Learning to predict whether a loan application is approved or not based on various input features such as applicant information, credit score, and loan history. The project uses Scikit-learn for training the model and includes various steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation. The goal is to assist lenders in automating the process of loan approval.

Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
